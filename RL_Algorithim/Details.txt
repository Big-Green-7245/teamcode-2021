RL workflow will be as follows, though I'm not exactly sure how to implement
it yet as of 10/7/20.

1. Environment (We will likely due simulations on matlab using my computer via remote desktop)

2. Reward Signal (The incentive for the agent to do what we want. Idk yet)

3. Policy (The structure of logic and parameters that an agent can make + do)

4. Training Alg (We'll just use the q-learning algorithim for now)

5. Deploy and test (robot will likely crash a bunch so we have to adjust stuff)
